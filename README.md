# Road-Traffic-Accident

# Project Title: Road Traffic Accident Data Analysis using Power BI
# Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze road traffic accident data to identify key patterns, causes, and severity of accidents. The analysis helps decision-makers take preventive measures to reduce accident rates.
# Tools Used:
Power BI
Microsoft Excel (CSV Dataset)
Data Cleaning (Power Query)
Data Visualization
# Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains 12,316 records and 32 columns related to road traffic accidents, including:
Accident Time & Date
Weather Conditions
Road Surface Conditions
Vehicle Type
Driver Experience
Cause of Accident
Number of Casualties
Accident Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
# Key Insights Visualized:
Visualization	             Insights Provided
Total Accidents KPI	       Shows the total number of accidents reported
Fatal Accidents KPI	       Indicates the number of fatal accidents
Accident Frequency Heatmap Highlights peak accident times by day
Accidents by Vehicle Type	 Identifies high-risk vehicles involved in accidents
Top Causes of Accidents	   Lists the most common accident causes
Weather Impact on Accidents	Analyzes how weather conditions affect accidents
Driver Experience vs Severity Shows how driver experience impacts severity
Geospatial Analysis	       Visualizes accident hotspots by area
# Data Cleaning Process:
Missing values handled by filling with "Unknown"
Date & Time column transformed into hourly bins
Removed duplicates and inconsistent data
# Dashboard Features:
✅ Interactive Filters
✅ Custom KPIs
✅ Heatmaps
✅ Top N Analysis
✅ Dark Modern Design
# Challenges Faced:
Handling missing values
Visualizing time-based accident patterns
Filtering top accident causes dynamically
# Conclusion:
The Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth understanding of road traffic accidents. It helps authorities identify accident-prone areas, peak times, and key contributing factors, aiding in better decision-making and safety measures.
