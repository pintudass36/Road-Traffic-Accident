# Road-Traffic-Accident

# Project Title: Road Traffic Accident Data Analysis using Power BI
# Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze road traffic accident data to identify key patterns, causes, and severity of accidents. The analysis helps decision-makers take preventive measures to reduce accident rates.
# Tools Used:
Power BI
Microsoft Excel (CSV Dataset)
Data Cleaning (Power Query)
Data Visualization
# Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains 12,316 records and 32 columns related to road traffic accidents, including:
Accident Time & Date
Weather Conditions
Road Surface Conditions
Vehicle Type
Driver Experience
Cause of Accident
Number of Casualties
Accident Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
# Key Insights Visualized:
Visualization: Total Accidents KPI, Fatal Accidents KPI, Accident Frequency Heatmap, Accidents by Vehicle Type,	 
Top Causes of Accidents, Weather Impact on Accidents,	Driver Experience vs Severity, Geospatial Analysis.	
Insights Provided: Visualizes accident hotspots by area, Shows the total number of accidents reported, Indicates the number of fatal accidents,
Highlights peak accident times by day, Identifies high-risk vehicles involved in accidents, Lists the most common accident causes, 
Analyzes how weather conditions affect accidents, Shows how driver experience impacts severity
# Data Cleaning Process:
Missing values handled by filling with "Unknown"
Date & Time column transformed into hourly bins
Removed duplicates and inconsistent data
# Dashboard Features:
✅ Interactive Filters
✅ Custom KPIs
✅ Heatmaps
✅ Top N Analysis
✅ Dark Modern Design
# Challenges Faced:
Handling missing values
Visualizing time-based accident patterns
Filtering top accident causes dynamically
# Conclusion:
The Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth understanding of road traffic accidents. It helps authorities identify accident-prone areas, peak times, and key contributing factors, aiding in better decision-making and safety measures.
